	<h2><a id="lineBets">Pass Line and Don't Pass Line Bets</a></h2>
	<p>
		Line bets are the main bets in Craps. How the current dice roller begins and ends his turn is 
		detirmined by when a line bet begins and ends. Line bets can only be made before on the current dice roller's 
		first dice roll. On this first roll three things can happen:
		<ul>
			<li>The roller can roll a 7 or 11 on their first try causing the Pass Line Bet to win and the Don't Pass Line Bet to lose.</li>
			<li>The roller can roll a 2, 3, or 12 on their first try causing the Pass Line Bet to lose and Don't Pass Line Bet to win.</li>
			<li>The roller can roll a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 cause the point to be set at the corresponding dice value.</li>
		</ul>
		Once a "point" is set the roller will keep rolling the dice until they roll the point value or a 7. Rolling the point 
		value will cause the Pass Line Bet to win and Don't Pass Line bet to lose. Rolling a 7 will result in the Pass Line Bet 
		losing and Don't Pass Line Bet to win. The paying odds on all Line bets at 1:1. Once a Pass Line Bet wins or loses the dice 
		are passed to the next player.
	</p>
	<h2><a id="oddsBets">Pass Odds and Don't Pass Odds</a></h2>
	<p>
		Odds bets are tied in with Line bets. Odds bets can only be made after the point is established (i.e. after the first roll). 
		Once the point is established bets placed on the Pass Odds bet will win if the current point value is rolled before a 7. 
		Conversly, a Don't Pass Odds bet will win if a 7 is rolled before the current point value. The payout of this bets 
		depends on the current point value.
	</p>
	<h2><a id="singleBets">Single Roll Bets</a></h2>
	<p>
		There are many bets that can be made on the next value of the dice and have no relation to the Line bets.
		Here's a list of single roll bets that will win only if the next dice roll is the corresponding value.
		<ul>
			<li>Field Bet: Wins if a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 is rolled. If a 2 is rolled odds paid are 2:1 and if a 12 is rolled odds paid are 3:1. Otherwise odds paid are 1:1</li>
			<li>Any Seven: Wins if a 7 is rolled. Odds paid are 4:1.</li>
			<li>Ace-Deuce: Wins if a 3 is rolled. Odds paid are 15:1.</li>
			<li>Snake Eyes: Wins if a 2 is rolled. Odds paid are 30:1</li>
			<li>Boxcars: Wins if a 12 is rolled. Odds paid are 30:1.</li>
			<li>Yo: Wins if an 11 is rolled. Odds paid are 15:1.</li>
			<li>Any Craps: Wins if a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled. Odds paid are 7:1</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2><a id="placeBets">Place Bets</a></h2>
	<p>
		Place bets can be made after a point is established by the roller. A place bet can be made on 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. 
		Place bets only win if the value bet on is rolled before a 7. If a 7 is before the betted on value then the beter loses.
		The payout of the place bets depends on the value bet upon. 4 and 10 payout 9:5, 5 and 9 payout 7:5, and 6 and 8 payout 7:6.
	</p>
	<h2><a id="hardWayBets">Hard Way Bets</a></h2>
	<p>
		Hard way bets are similar to place bets but with a slight twist, the user must roll the value bet upon and both dice must
		have the same value, e.g. if a Hard Way Four bet is made the only to win is to roll a four with each dice having a value of 2.
		If a seven is rolled or the value is rolled and the dice do not match values then the bet loses. Hard Way bets can be placed on 
		4, 6, 8, and 10. 4 and 10 payout 7:1 and 6 and 8 payout 9:1.
	</p>
	<h2><a id="comeBets">Come and Don't Come Bets</a></h2>
	<p>
		Come and Don't Come work exactly like Pass and Don't Pass Line bets. Once a beter bets on a Come Bet they can win immediately
		by having a 7 or 11 be rolled. If a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled the Come Bet immediately loses. Otherwise a "point" is established 
		for that specific come bet and can only be won if that value is rolled before a 7. Come bets can be made at anytime besides 
		when a new Line bet is out and can be made one right after another. Don't Come bets win when Come Bets lose. Both bets have a 1:1 payout.
